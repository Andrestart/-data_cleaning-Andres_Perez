This is Andres Perez's shark attack data cleaning and visualization project.

This is the explanation of the project.
If you open the file "1_data_cleaning.ipynb", you can start visualizing the project. You will need to have jupyter notebook installed, as well as the libraries specified in the first cell.

After importing these libraries, you can go on executing the cells. You will be directed through the jupyter notebook markdown and code cells, that are explanatory of the data cleaning process. In order to fully understand this process, you will need to open the "cleaning_functions.py" file, where I have created my own functions that have been imported as new library called "src.cleaning_functions" as "cf".

All functions in "src.cleaning_functions" are commented and explained, please read them in order to understand their functioning.

During my stay in Australia, I always heard that surfers are the most attacked by sharks, but nobody had the proof. This is my opportunity to know if that's correct or just a myth. It was also heard that summer was the most dangerous seasons when it comes to shark attacks.

Because of what I explained above, I have chosen 2 hypothesis that I want to prove after cleaning this data, which are:
Do sharks attack more often in Australia on summer?
Are surfers the most targeted by sharks?

I have deleted the rows and columns that are not needed in order to prove these hypothesis.

After having read the file "1_data_cleaning.ipynb", open "2_graphs.ipynb" to see the graphs and their conclusion.

You can also find the cleaned tables and these graphs in the folder "graphs_and_tables".
